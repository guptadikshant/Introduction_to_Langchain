        You can reach out your destination by following below steps:
        First you have to book a flight. To book a flight you can use any of the online service provider. There are 2 options to book a flight.
        a) which has some layover in between.
        b) which goes directlty to destination

        The layover options are: Gulf Air flight number GF 131, layover of 3hrs 25 mins at Bahrain and then to destination London-Heathrow Apt.
        Total  cost will be Rs. 28343 per person.

        The direct options are: Vistra flight UK 17 has total cost Rs. 67225, British Airways BA 142 has total cost Rs. 69891


        Now, to reach airport to pick the flight which is booked in step-1. All international flights fly from Terminal-3(T3) and domestic 
        flights fly from Terminal-1(T1) and Terminal-2(T2). 
        To reach Indira Gandhi International Airport, Terminal-3, you can go via cab which can be booked by Cabs/Metro/Buses.
        
        The cab can be booked via Uber/Ola/Private Taxis. The fare will be Rs 600 to Rs 800 and will directly dropped to destination.
        
        The nearest metro station near Shahdara, Delhi is Shahadara Metro station. You have to change metro from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate then 
        from Kashmere Gate to New Delhi and from New Delhi to Terminal-3 via Airport Metro line. This change of station is required because there
        is no direct metro from Shahdara, Delhi to Airport. Total cost is Rs. 45.

        For buses you can make use of Delhi Transport Corporation(DTC) which only runs in Delhi NCR(National Capital Region).
        The buses run every 20 mins and some buses are 717, 717B. It is good you confirm first which bus run on your flight day.
        The cost of fare will Rs. 70 and will take 45 mins.        
        The nearest bus station is IFFCO Chowk which you can reach by Metro ut you have first board from Shahdara and then from Shahdara to
        Kashmere gate then from Kashmere gate to IFFCO Chowk. But this route is completely opposite and will take lots of unnecessary time.
        This route will be suitable for those who lives near to IFFCO Chowk.

        The most economical and convenient option is Metro if you have less luggage but if you have more luggage and more people, I suggest to go
        via Cab to Airport.
